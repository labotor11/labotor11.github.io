The idea is that we build templates in which the client can insert their own data into (images, text, etc) and it works across sizes and languages. A very large-scale project, spanning multiple months - I was brought in to concept and create the default designs that the system will adhere to. A very long process, in part due to how many clients were involved with the feedback process - but ultimately paid off as the end-result is flexible enough for the client to use and re-use with ease.
